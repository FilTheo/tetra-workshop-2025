        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p><strong>In today's business landscape, data-driven solutions have transitioned from being a competitive
            advantage to a fundamental requirement.</strong> Forecasting serves as the foundation for informed,
          data-driven decision-making, crucial for organizations aiming to optimize their operational practices.
          However, many organizations encounter difficulties not due to inadequate forecasting itself, but rather
          because of a lack of structured, business-oriented methodologies for its implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>This intensive three-day workshop offers a comprehensive, all-around introduction to forecasting for
            business environments.</strong> Designed for professionals with no prior technical or programming
          background, it covers the entire forecasting lifecycleâ€”from defining what to forecast and why, to evaluating
          results and making actionable decisions. Designed based on real-world projects from successful collaborations
          with business partners, this workshop provides an intuitive understanding of the core forecasting principles
          paired with step-by-step implementation strategies that have delivered measurable business value.</p>
        <p><strong>Participants will follow a logical progression through the entire forecasting lifecycle</strong>. It
          starts with the fundamental concepts of time series and how to scope forecasting tasks based on business
          needs. The curriculum then explores various modeling approaches, from simple models that still deliver strong
          business value to more advanced machine learning techniques that have reshaped how large-scale operational
          forecasting is approached. The final sessions focus on assessing forecast quality and effectively turning
          forecasts into actionable decisions, with a strong emphasis on understanding and managing future uncertainty.
