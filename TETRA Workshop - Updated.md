### **Title: Modern Business Forecasting in Practice**

Duration: 3 days, 2-2.30 hours per day 

Location:

Dates: (To be announced)

**Abstract:**

**In today’s business landscape, data-driven solutions have transitioned from being a competitive advantage to a fundamental requirement.** Forecasting serves as the foundation for informed, data-driven decision-making, crucial for organizations aiming to optimize their operational practices. However, many organizations encounter difficulties not due to inadequate forecasting itself, but rather because of a lack of structured, business-oriented methodologies for its implementation.

**This intensive three-day workshop offers a comprehensive, all-around introduction to forecasting for business environments.** Designed for professionals with no prior technical or programming background, it covers the entire forecasting lifecycle—from defining what to forecast and why, to evaluating results and making actionable decisions. Designed based on real-world projects from successful collaborations with business partners, this workshop provides an intuitive understanding of the core forecasting principles paired with step-by-step implementation strategies that have delivered measurable business value. 

**Participants will follow a logical progression through the entire forecasting lifecycle**. It starts with the fundamental concepts of time series and how to scope forecasting tasks based on business needs. The curriculum then explores various modeling approaches, from simple models that still deliver strong business value to more advanced machine learning techniques that have reshaped how large-scale operational forecasting is approached. The final sessions focus on assessing forecast quality and effectively turning forecasts into actionable decisions, with a strong emphasis on understanding and managing future uncertainty.

**Workshop Goals**

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

* Get familiar with  the fundamental components of time series data   
* Gain a clear understanding of the complete forecasting lifecycle, from problem scoping to implementation.  
* Explore a broad range of forecasting models, with detailed insights into their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different types of business problems.  
* Learn the core principles of evaluating forecasting performance effectively  
* Understand how to translate forecasts into actionable strategic or operational decisions while accounting for uncertainty and risk.

**Target Audience**

* This workshop is designed for data scientists, business analysts, decision-makers seeking to implement forecasting solutions, and applied scientists wanting to adopt industry-robust techniques.   
* Real-world examples from successful case studies are used throughout to ground concepts in practical applications.   
* **No coding experience is required.**
